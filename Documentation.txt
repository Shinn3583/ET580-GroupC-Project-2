C. Known Problems or Incomplete Code

- 11/15 – Phase I Tasks 8 and 9 (Sikder Ishaq) ---
- Implemented and documented driver tests in `Driver_Phase1.cpp` 
  - Use `empty`, `push_front`, `push_back`, `print`.
  - Traverse with iterator (`begin`, `hasNext`, `next`, `getData`).
  - Demonstrate `find` only 
- Fixed encapsulation access 
- Corrected `Makefile` target names and dependencies; validated build via `g++` on Windows.
- Verified a clean compile and successful run; output shows functions working.
